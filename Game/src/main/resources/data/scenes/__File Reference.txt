The Turtle starts at 0,0 (the middle of the screen, visible coordinates

The Pen defaults to being down.

#pendown                 (Instruction, here pendown (to start drawing))
(50.5,13)                (coordinates to move to, as screen positions from -100 to 100)
#penup                   (Instruction, here penup (to stop drawing)
